# Part I:  read in data sets and merge them


# Part II:  Extract measurements only on the mean and std of each measurement

# Part III:  Descriptive Activity Names for activities in dataset

# Part IV:  Dataset should have appropriate/descriptive variable names

# Part V:  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
#   with the average of each variable for *each activity* and *each subject*.
