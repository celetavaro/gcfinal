# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

An interesting source of data is mobile and wearable technology that track activities and movement.  This project uses data from a Galaxy S smartphone.  The data in this project contains information collected by the Accelerometer and Gyroscope on the smartphone.  The data has been merged, cleaned, and finally made into a tidy dataset
